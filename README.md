### Node.js project for dev ops with docker course
An exercise from the course required me to create a docker image of a public repository and publish it to docker hub

So I wrote this is a simple node project that outputs a random message each 5 seconds.

# Setup project
1) Install node.js on your machine (an LTS version for example)
2) And then execute the command ``node main.js``
3) This script should output a random message each 5 seconds.
